# book-inventory-managment
## Summary
This is a minimal [PHP](http://www.php.net/) application that tracks and stores information about books in a [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) database.

## Features
- Read and display all books in the database
- Create a new book
- Delete a book
- Update a book

## Directions to run locally
1. clone the repo
2. install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
3. move project directory to `/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/`
4. open XAMPP from `/Applications/XAMPP/XAMPP.app`
5. click on `start servers`
6. navigate to `localhost:8888` in a web browser

 _Note: You will also need to set up your local SQLite database. See official docs [here](https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html). Unless you change my code, you'll need to name the database `test` and create a `books` table in that db._
 
 _Note: Users on Mac can ignore the above XMAMP directions and download [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/) instead. Not sure of the specific setup, but they probably have good docs?_
